**Introduction**

In this mini-project the key-focus is how we can predict the outcome from the given trained dataset by giving the input through simple Web-UI.


Using the Code

For this project I have used a basic dataset from Kaggle ("https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database"). The dataset is about the diabetes patients and predicts if the patient can have diabetes or not. For creating the model Deep Learning algorithm has been used.


Since the dataset is trained and and we have saved the model, we will create a normal WebUI having a form which collects all the information/column names from the user and predicts the output. To create a webapp we'll be using Flask Framework with python.




The complete web-app I've created on a container technology called as DOCKER. Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and deploy it as one package.

The libraries / software that are used:

Tensorflow 2.4>
keras
Flask
Docker
render_template
Public Cloud like AWS
The complete Docker image I've uploaded on Docker hub. The link to the image is: "https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/arindam7013/flask_project_1"

For Higher availability of the project I will be deploying this whole setup on a Public Cloud like AWS/AZURE/GCP so that anyone can access it around the world.
